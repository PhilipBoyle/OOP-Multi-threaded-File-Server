This is a simple multi-threaded file server application built using Java.

The application can be used using the command line.

You will be presented with the following options:
1. Connect to Server
2. Print File Listing
3. Download File
4. Quit

Explanation of options:
1. This establishes a conection to the server.***
2. Displays a full list of files available for download.
3. Downloads a file to the user's computer.
4. Exits the Application.

***Unfortunately I could nto get this functionality implemented so the connection 
is automatically established upon running the application.

Thank you for using.
